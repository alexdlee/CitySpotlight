# City Spotlight
This is an iOS application that highlights local area small businesses with the ultimate goal of growing their customer bases. 
My inspiration for this idea came from my experience helping two small businesses. After learning about their impactful goals and missions, I set
out for a new approach to reaching customers - an app like Yelp, but only featuring small, obscure Austin-area businesses, along with descriptions,
images, a website link, and details of their origin stories.

## Features
Features of this application include the ability for users to input the name of small businesses they would like to be featured 
on the app, which are then recorded in a database for future implementation. In addition, a fully functioning search tool, with filters, is available 
for users to browse through the specific restaurants/activities they are interested in. Finally, the application does utilize location services
in order to sort businesses by distance and present a map UI that marks the different small businesses users have visited in the area. Users may also
save favorite businesses and create journal entries about them.

# Future Modifications
I would like to implement a user voting system to highlight one small business every week, a "Business Spotlight." Second, I would 
like to implement gamification features, allowing users to earn in-game points and badges for each business they visit. 

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Open XCode and choose the "Clone Git Repository" option and paste the url.
