# CitySpotlight

I would like to develop an app that highlights local area small businesses to increase their customer base. 
My inspiration for this idea came from my experience with two small businesses, as I noticed that they both 
lacked a large customer base despite possessing great potential to help my community. This app wouldn't include 
the well-known businesses in the area, and instead, highlight the origin stories of small businesses to help my 
users develop personal connections with these businesses. I would also like to implement a system to highlight 
one small business every week, a "Business Spotlight." In addition, another feature I would like to implement 
would be the ability for users to journal their experiences with pictures and words at these small businesses and
earn in-game points for each business they visit. Aspects of my project I would require assistance with would be
finding small businesses to add to my app, some programming, and helping showcase my app to gain users.
